# Challenge Nine

This challenge was definitely one of the hardest there is in the [Foundry Course](https://github.com/Cyfrin/foundry-full-course-f23)
Here I created a simple contract to solve the challenge!

## Quickstart
Configure the `.env` variables. Then:
```
make deploy
```
This only works on Arbitrum and the NFT and challenge address are hardcoded into the contract:

- LessonNine: https://arbiscan.io/address/0xdF7cdFF0c5e85c974D6377244D9A0CEffA2b7A86#code
- FoundryNFT: https://arbiscan.io/address/0x39338138414Df90EC67dC2EE046ab78BcD4F56D9
